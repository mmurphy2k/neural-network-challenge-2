## 1. **Program Description**

You are tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so you are also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.

## 3. **Prerequisites**
```bash
pip install pandas tensorflow sklearn keras
```
If unable to install tensorflow or keras on your local machine due to requirements for processor, you will need to run this file from Google Colab. 


## 4. **How to run the notebook**


Within VS Code, select the **"attrition.ipynb"** file and execute each of the code cells within the notebook from top to bottom in order.

Within Google Colab, open the file **"attrition.ipynb"** and execute each of the code cells within the notebook from top to bottom in order.


## 5. **README.md**

This file. 


## 6. **attrition.ipynb**

This notebook contains the various code cells that will cover the following:

1. Part 1: Preprocessing.
2. Part 2: Create, Compile, and Train the Model.
3. Part 3: Summary.

## 7. **Accuracy Results**

After running this code and tweaking a few parameters, I found this to result the highest accuracy results to date. I know addition modification could results in a possible better score.
